If you want to port rxtx to a new Unix platform do the following.

*IMPORTANT* you will need gnu make.

There are probably two areas you will need to focus on:

configure.in

src/SerialImp.c src/ParallelImp.c

configure.in grabs information about the OS, Java, ... and tries to set sane
values for the Makefile.  Look towards the bottom of configure.in and just
copy *bsd or HP-UX.  Modify to your liking.

Edit configure.in, run autoconf, run configure, run make.  repeat. An endless 
loop analagous to shampoo instructions.

SerialImp.c and ParallelImp.c may require system specific includes and possibly
a small amount of #ifdef's in the code.  

Finally, I've got this beast compiling on hp-ux but I think the compile flags
need adjusting.  Keep that in mind while looking through the files.

Common problems include the following varibles in the Makefile

      JAVAINCLUDE
      JAVANATINC
      CLASSPATH

Which are defined in configure.in

We will gladly help with any UNIX platform.  Send questions to
trentjarvi@yahoo.com.  New OS's usually require tweaks.

If its not compiling try backing out functionality until it compiles.

win32 support has not been tested.  Contact trentjarvi@yahoo.com if your 
interested in developing win32 support.   

For all Unix flavors... If the package did not work out of the box please
see BUGS and send a comment.
