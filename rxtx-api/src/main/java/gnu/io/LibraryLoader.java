     * Tries to find and load the correct version of a given library.
     *
     * <p>To use a Java Native Interface library, a separate library must be
     * available for each operating system and CPU architecture combination,
     * which is supported. To make JNI work, the proper library for the current
     * system is determined at runtime.</p>
     *
     * <p>This method finds the proper library using the following naming
     * conventions:</p>
     *
     * <p>The <i>non hinted base name</i> is simply a (short) file base name.
     * For example some library <i>Foo Bar Lib</i> might have a non hinted base
     * name of <i>foobar</i>.
     *
     * <p>The <i>non hinted library name</i> is the mapped version of the non
     * hinted base name. It was mapped to the operating system's naming
     * convention for dynamic libraries using the System.mapLibraryName()
     * method. This will typically assign a system dependent file extension. For
     * example the non hinted library name of the <i>Foo Bar Lib</i> on Windows
     * is <i>foobar.dll</i>. On linux it might look like <i>foobar.so</i>.
     *
     * The <i>hinted base name</i> starts with the non hinted base name. Then
     * the operating system &lt;os&gt; and architecture &lt;arch&gt; hints
     * follow, each separated by a dash (&#45; ASCII #45, U+002D). Therefor the
     * <i>hinted base name</i> is formed as follows:</p>
     *
     * <p> &lt;libBaseName&gt;&#45;&lt;os&gt;&#45;&lt;arch&gt; </p>
     *
     * <p>The exact values for the &lt;os&gt; and &lt;arch&gt; fields are given
     * in the following tables.</p>
     *
     * <table>
     * <tr><td><b>&lt;os&gt;</b></td><td><b>operating system</b></td></tr>
     * <tr><td>linux</td><td>Linux</td></tr>
     * <tr><td>windows</td><td>Windows 95 to Windows 8</td></tr>
     * <tr><td>osx</td><td>Mac OS X</td></tr>
     * </table>
     *
     * <table>
     * <tr><td><b>&lt;arch&gt;</b></td><td><b>architecture</b></td></tr>
     * <tr><td>x86</td><td>x86, i386 - i686</td></tr>
     * <tr><td>x86_64</td><td>x86 with 64 bit extension (amd64)</td></tr>
     * </table>
     *
     * <p>Please note: The target architecture of the library must fit the
     * architecture of the used Java Virtual Machine and NOT the architecture
     * used by the operating system. For example the hinted base name of the
     * <i>Foo Bar Lib</i> on a 32 bit (x86) JVM running on a 64 bit (x86_64)
     * Windows is <i>foobar-windows-x86</i></p>
     *
     * <p>The <i>hinted library name</i> is the mapped version of the hinted
     * base name. It was mapped to the operating system's naming convention for
     * dynamic libraries using the System.mapLibraryName() method. This will
     * typically assign a system dependent file extension. For example the
     * hinted library name of the <i>Foo Bar Lib</i> on Windows x86
     * is <i>foobar-windows-x86.dll</i>. On linux it might look like
     * <i>foobar-linux-x86.so</i>.
     *
     * <p>This method tries to find the library from the following locations in
     * the given order:
     * <ul>
     * <li>Using the resources of the class loader (e.g. JAR file) with the
     * hinted library name.</li>
     * <li>On the java library path with the hinted library name.</li>
     * <li>On the java library path with the non-hinted library name.</li>
     * </ul>
     * If the library was found in one location, the search is stopped without
     * looking in further locations.
     * </p>
     *
     * @param nonHintedBaseName the non hinted base name of the library to load
     * @return true if the proper library was found and loaded, false otherwise
