1.4.12 release of RXTX - GNU implementation of communication API for JAVA
was released today:
http://www.rxtx.org

MAC OS X specific notes:

System requirement:
OS:	MAC OS X 10.1
10.0.X users, (I didn't check it)
expand file RXTX.pkg.sit.hqx (MACOSX_IDE/ForPackageMaker folder)
try to install RXTX binaries from MACOSX_IDE/ForPackageMaker/RXTX.pkg
and read AFTER INSTALLATION notes below

ProjectBuilder 1.1 (from 10.1 tools)
or
CodeWarrior 7

you should download SUN's comm api before start
http://java.sun.com/products/javacomm/index.html
choose solaris version
follow download instructions

1. Download 1.4.12 package:
http://www.frii.com/~jarvi/rxtx/download/rxtx-1.4-12.tar.gz
2.expand it (you can use Stuffit expander or any appropriate unix tool)
3.go to MACOSX_IDE folder


  4.ProjectBuilder development
    goto folder PB
	expand file LibSerial.pbproj.sit.hqx
	open LibSerial.pbproj project
	choose libSerial.jnilib target
        build
	after build you will find comm.jar and libSerial.jnilib files in 
build directory
	(if you can't find comm.jar (unlikely) build comm.jar target manually)

5. CodeWarrior
	open libSerial.mcp project
	goto jnilib target
	build
	after build you will find comm.jar and libSerial.jnilib files in 
project's directory
	(if you can't found comm.jar (unlikely) build java target manually)
	

INSTALLATION:
	MANUALLY:
		copy comm.jar -> 
/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Home/lib/ext folder
		copy libSerial.jnilib -> /usr/lib/java
		create text file javax.comm.properties
		this file should contain only one line:
		Driver=gnu.io.RXTXCommDriver
  		(you can found this file in folder:
	
	MACOSX_IDE/ForPackageMaker/Install/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/
Home/lib)
		copy javax.comm.properties -> 
/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Home/lib folder
		use sudo command if it's necessary
	PackageMaker package:
		CodeWarrior developers: before starting creating installation 
package do following step:
			copy comm.jar into 
MACOSX_IDE/ForPackageMaker/Install/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/
Home/lib/ext
			copy libSerial.jnilib into 
MACOSX_IDE/ForPackageMaker/Install/usr/lib/java folder

		open file RXTX.pmsp
		fix absolute path to Install and Resources folder
		it should point to MACOSX_IDE/ForPackageMaker/Install
		and MACOSX_IDE/ForPackageMaker/Resources
		respectively
		create package - PACKAGE's NAME MUST BE RXTX.pkg
		(if you want to change Readme or Welcome messages you may edit
		files Readme.rtf or Welcome.rtf from 
MACOSX_IDE/ForPackageMaker/Resources folder)

AFTER INSTALLATION VERY IMPORTANT
	check existence of the folder /var/spool/uucp
	if you don't have it create it with command
	sudo mkdir /var/spool/uucp
	permissions should be: drwxrwxr-x
	if they are not do command
	sudo chmod 775 /var/spool/uucp

	YOU should be a member of the uucp group
	you can check it with command
		niutil -readprop / /groups/uucp users
	you should see your name in output of the niutil command
	if you don't do following:
		sudo niutil -appendprop / /groups/uucp users <yourname>
			substitute  <yourname> with your user's name
			for example if your user name is peter:
				sudo niutil -appendprop / /groups/uucp users peter

	NOTES: RXTX.pkg should create uucp folder and insert your name  in 
uucp group automatically

THAT's IT!!!!!!!!!

--------------------- Gnu Tool Builds -----------------------

If you are going to try building rxtx on Mac OS X, we recommend you use
rxtx 1.5.   1.4 would require substantial modification to the Makefile to
get the build to work.

Mac OS X has some issues with libtool at this time.  This makes building
rxtx much more difficult.

The current solution is to take an automatically generated Makefile and then
manually edit it.

One such Makefile is provided to help build rxtx.  The file will probably
need to be edited to match your system configuration.  If you would like to
add more information for other Mac OS X users please email

	trentjarvi@yahoo.com

We are sorry the build process is not easier.  A great deal of effort was
put into trying to automate the builds without luck.
